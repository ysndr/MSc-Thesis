The Nickel Language Server follows a history of previous research and development in the domain of modern language tooling and editor integration.
Most importantly, it is part of a growing set of LSP integrations.
As such, it is important to get a picture of the field of current LSP projects.
This chapter will survey a varied range of popular language servers, compare common capabilities, and implementation approaches.
Additionally, this part aims to recognize alternative approaches to the LSP, in the form of legacy protocols, extensible development platforms LSP extensions and the emerging Language Server Index Format.

### LSP Extensions

The LSP defines a large range of commands and capabilities which is continuously being extended by the maintainers of the protocol.
Yet, occasionally server developers find themselves in need of functionality not yet present in the protocol.
For example the LSP does not provide commands to exchange binary data such as files.
In [@sec:language-independence] the CodeCompass Language Server was introduced.
A stern feature of this server is the ability to generate and show diagrams in SVG format.
However, the LSP does not define the concept of *requesting diagrams*.
In particular Mészáros et al. describe different shortcomings of the LSP :

1. The "LSP doesn’t have a feature to place a context menu at an arbitrary spot in the document"
   Context menu entries are implemented by clients based on the agreed upon capabilities of the server.
   Undefined capabilities cannot be added to the context menu.

   In the case of CodeCompass the developers made up for this by using the code completion feature as an alternative dynamic context menu.

2. "LSP does not support displaying pictures (diagrams)".
   CodeCompass generates diagrams for selected code.
   Yet, there is no image transfer included with the LSP.
   Since the LSP is based on JSON-RPC messages, the authors' solution was to define a new command, specifically designed to tackle this non-standard use case.


Missing features of the protocol such as the ones pointed out by Mészáros et al. appear frequently, especially in complex language servers or ones that implement more than basic code processing.

The rust-analyzer defines almost thirty non-standard commands [@rust-analyzer-extensions], to enable different language specific actions.

Taking the idea of the CodeCompass project further, Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. propose a generic extension of the LSP for graphical modeling [@lsp-for-graphical-modeling].
Their approach is based on a generic intermediate representation of graphs which can be generated by language servers and turned into a graphical representation by the client implementation.

Similarly, in [@Specification-Language-Server-Protocol,@decoupling-core-analysis-support] the authors describe a method to develop language agnostic LSP extensions.
In their work they defined a language server protocol for specification languages (SLSP) which builds on top of the existing LSP, but adds several additional commands.
The commands are grouped by their use case in the domain of specification languages and handles by separate modules of the client extension implementing support for the SLSP.
Following the LSP example and defining commands language agnostic instead of tied to a specific language, allows to maintain the initial purpose of the LSP.
Since the extensions can be incorporated by specific implementations of language servers in the same domain, a single client implementation serves multiple languages.
The authors point out that while their approach specializes in specification languages, the idea can be transferred to other areas.
