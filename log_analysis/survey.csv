However it's not always usable when editing the file in neovim + coc.nvim. Maybe it's due to how events are sent to the LSP, but it seems the LSP queues a lot of work and doesn't respond for sometimes tenth of seconds, as if it was processing with a delay all of the atomic changes I made.",3: The feature worked without an issue,3: Most to all expectations were met,4,"The features works well, is quick.

It is missing record field completion, which is arguably more difficult to do, but important in a record-based language like Nickel.",3,"It's hard to assess, because there are two dimensions. When the document is not modified, the response time was instantaneous for any operation from my user's point of view. However, when modifying a document, it was slow to very slow on neovim, and we could see the modification stacking (you do a modification, and then for the following seconds, see several delayed ghost diagnostics for your intermediate invalid code until it reaches a new state of no error). I don't know if it is experienced the same on VSCode. Sometimes it even pumped almost all of CPU and didn't respond anymore.",
