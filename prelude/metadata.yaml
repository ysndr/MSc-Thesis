  The expansive Language Integration, i.e. code completion, debugging as well as static code analysis, refactoring and more, has typically been the hallmark of Integrated Development Environments (IDE).
  Typcal IDEs however focus on a selection of estabished languages to integrate which stifles the adoption of new languages.
  Contrasting IDEs, modular text editors allow for plugin driven integration of languages as contribued by thir spective communities.
  Yet, providing language integration to multiple platforms requires repeated efforts for each one.
  The Language Server Protcol aims to be a solution to this problem by connecting a language specific Language Server to editors which act as generic clients.
  This work presents the design of a transferable Language Server architecture and its implementation for the Nickel languages.
  The product is finally evaluated quantitatively for its performance and qulaitatively for its perception by future users.
